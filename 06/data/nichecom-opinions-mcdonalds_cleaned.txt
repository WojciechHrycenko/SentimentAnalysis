It have been great so far. The people are really kind and welcoming. I have working in a few different fast food settings and so far this one has been my favorite. Although something the scheduling system in not always the best at being accurate but other than that they do a great job training and wecloming new hire. Overall it is a great job and I would recommend it especially for peoples first job.

The Mcdonalds that I work at is a very good job. The only problem with the job is the management and the owners. The management puts strict rules on the employees, such as requiring managers to request time off a month in advance. I understand that we are supposed to take our job very seriously but at the end of the day, we work at a fast food place.

The overall experience of working at a McDonald's isn't bad. It is easy to get hired, and they are almost always looking to hire. I liked the people I worked with and they made the job much better. On of the biggest things I would change is the pay rates from store to store. Depending on who franchised the store, you could start out making minimum wage or start at a solid pay depending on your boss.

I worked at McDonald's from my sophomore year to my senior year for one year and ten months. Initially, I started this job because one of my close friends was applying and wanted to work with me. Balancing work with school and extracurriculars was challenging, but I became accustomed to it. Over time, this job taught me responsibility for how I manage my time and doing what needs to be done. I can't say I enjoyed my whole experience at McDonald's as there were a plethora of managers with unsatisfactory perceptions on how to run a business. However, I am thankful for what this job taught me and the money it allowed me to save and spend.

There is a reason people call it the best first job. I have been employed at McDonald's for years and have had a great time.

Working at a McDonald’s, let alone any fast food chain, can be a very stressful experience. Despite this, McDonald’s can be a very good entry level job for those who are entering the workforce. Working at a McDonald’s has also helped me personally with my social skills. As someone who considers themselves a bit of a hermit, working at McDonald’s has helped me come out of my shell a bit, working with both customers and fellow crew members. I would highly recommend working here if you are just coming out of high school or are currently in high school, as long as you can handle the pressure.

The job is actually fun, but it can be very challenging and high-paced. Extremely high-paced. The job has allowed me to meet more people and learn to step out of my comfort zone.

Working as a crew member at McDonald's is a rewarding experience for me. The fast-paced environment sharpens my multitasking skills, and the supportive team creates a positive work atmosphere.

The experience in McDonald's is a good way to start and learn about many different personalities, within the job and customers. As a crew trainer, the job requires to put check on the employees and help out the managers manage their floor. What I liked in the job was the employees and showing us different skill sets and still learning at the customer service. The change in McDonald's is to not have any favoritism and personal vendetta against some employees, I do not always see that and when I do, I just observe the situation before saying anything. The management do not work together most of the time, because they do not want to put up with customers or employees and just mad very easily. Most complaints at McDonald's are not the customer service, but the managers do get most of those complaints, due to their attitudes. I hope in the future, that changes before the McDonald's decides to shut down a particular spot.

I was met with various cleaning tasks on the second day of employment. For the next week, I would primarily clean surfaces, pipes, and fryers. After that week, I learned to serve customers their food and am self-taught for the rest of my responsibilities. I want a change in employee training to focus on tasks specific to their job role. As someone who applied as a Crew Member, I was trained more for maintenance responsibilities than customer service responsibilities. I'm sure this varies from location to location, however. If McDonald's overviewed employee training more strictly, I believe more employees would carry the skills necessary to carry out McDonald's goals.

McDonald’s customers expect to be treated with respect and kindness, and they expect employees to be knowledgeable and helpful when they have questions or need assistance. An interviewer wants to know how you would handle interactions with customers and how you would build positive relationships with them. They want to know that you understand the importance of customer service and will be able to provide the best experience possible.

I like how fast paced the job is. I hate sitting around, I love that I’m moving and on my feet. I love the McDonald’s app and how far it’s come. Not only is it easier for the employees but the customers as well. I would take away the time board at all McDonald’s, only because I feel it adds unnecessary pressure on the employees to keep a low average.

McDonald's is a work environment in which you have to balance the quality of services and the quality of food.

The job itself isn't bad at all, it's decently simple and generally flexible. It's good for first time workers or students who need specific hours. However, at its core it is customer service, and people can be difficult. I experienced all types of people, some of the nicest people I've ever met and some of the meanest. I actually liked this for the most part, as I love meeting different people. But, if you get overstimulated easy or struggle with multitasking, this job isn't for you. My main issue is that once I got much better at the job, they started scheduling me outside of my availability, and when I'd bring it up, they would only fix it for one week and go back to scheduling me outside of my availability. I would often feel pressured to stay later than I was scheduled, and if I declined, they were somewhat passive aggressive. Despite this, my coworkers were kind and managers were usually kind minus the few mean ones. Big plus, free food!!!!

This is a good beginner job and is quick to offer leadership roles if you prove yourself to be dedicated.

It was a lackluster experience overall. The hours are long, the managers will schedule you outside of your availability. There is a high chance of dealing with rude customers.

I like that it is a community and has a friendly atmosphere. I feel like I can tell them what is needed and they can help me. I also like that they said they have an open door so if there is something that I need to tell them, I feel like I am able to communicate with them.

It is fine when the building is decently staffed to handle waves of people. When the place is understaffed everything becomes overbearing and it becomes hard to handle. Everything is easy to learn and everyone around you is willing to talk to you and help you out. The way managers are with you is inconsistent, and the building I am at is an independently owned place, and when the owner comes in he is very lenient and understanding around others. I can work whatever hours I want and I don't feel dreadful coming into work and it is an okay experience for the portion of the day that I am there.

The work environment is very nice and the treatment at the job site is phenomenal. Every employee is nice and caring. When I first started they all welcomed me in such a nice way and immediately made me feel comfortable. Such a safe and comforting job, there's no job that I've worked for that treated me with such care and has employees that all have a strong bond that helps everyone communicate with no problem.

I have been working at McDonald’s for about a year and a half and I learned a lot. McDonald’s teaches me how to deal with different people and how to react quickly in different situations. It can be really fun depending on what coworkers you are working with and the managers that are working. Sometimes there are really strict managers working and it can get annoying because even when there isn’t any thing to do, the managers will just scream at you for standing around and talking. It can be difficult to attain hours because the person in charge of making the schedules tend to not do what you ask of them and will be very inconsistent with your schedule which is really unreliable. The pay has gone up since I worked there which is a plus. When I first started it was around 10 dollars and now I make 13.75 an hour. Overall I believe McDonald’s is a good job to work at because it gives you a lot of lessons. It also teaches you about different personalities and how to approach them.

The Mcdonald's company has taught me life skills and opened up my communication skills to its fullest. I liked that everyone worked as a team, yes there were days some of the employees would fuss over the speed and diligent care of the food. But, most days at Mcdonald's were good. The one I work at, I liked that we were a family, we have had holiday parties, birthday surprises, celebrations and even a picture wall of every employee that has worked there in the past 10 years. I do wish that Mcdonald's would care just a bit more for the workers in the kitchen, an entire summer I was the only female in the kitchen having to work while the air conditioning was broken and it would be 104 degrees . The work style is not at its greatest in the summer and if there was one thing that needs changing is a plan to fix the air conditioning and environment during hot summer days for all employees.

McDonald's will be a great experience for those who have not had a job before. You will build a foundation in the professional fast food world and also have a good time socializing with coworkers. I think the best part about McDonald's is that the company is so iconic whilst also being simple, thus the restaurant will almost always be busy 24/7. I have never experienced a boring day a McDonald's either in the day shifts or night shifts. I truly believe the only reason to leave this job is obviously you find a better job and pursue your career or a manager(s) that can ruin your experience.

Working at mcdonalds is pretty easy. I think it´s a very easy first job to make money from. Everybody can apply here, we hire anybody. As you work long enough you do get tired of fast food and having to suck up to the customers even if they´re completely wrong sometimes and it sucks. Having really hardworking and fun coworkers can also make your job not as bad as it seem it is. They can make your shift even go by fast.

Nice, fast pace environment. Lots of hands-on, interacting with customers, and a nice, informal environment. I have always been able to get plenty of hours and for the most part, they work with my school schedule and other things. However, clear inequality of pay and it is extremely difficult to get a raise when promised one and these raises are years between each other and there are no benefits (aside from a little bit of health insurance). The owners will do anything to keep the income in their own pockets.

Working at Mcdonalds builds work ethic. In my opinion, you may be new to a job, it's great for this to be your first job. It builds a sense of a member of a team and how you all must work as one. That works later on in life at other jobs, you want to be a viable piece in a team. What i like about working at Mcdonald's is of course not having to pay for your lunch. Also, what i did enjoy about working here is seeing new customers and even old customers. You build a simple bond with customers and it's a joy seeing them come in.

I believe Mc Donald's provide a lot of growth opportunities, but then it comes the time when you feel that you get stuck in the position, or doing the same thing over and over again. In other words, franchisees do not help to improve the situation, owners only wants profit and forget, how we get there? how many extra hours we are putting in, or the effort we are putting at work.

Mcdonalds is a great company to start your work career at . Not only does it show you how to work in a fast paced environment it also teaches you how to work in a group.

My experience working at McDonald so far has been quite poor. The shifts are very laboring and 5 times a week, the pay is not terrible for a senior in high-school, but working there is such a drag. I really hate my boss XhanXhan, he does not know how to work well with the employees. He is always yelling at us when we mess up and is very unforgiving even though i work very hard. Although The only good things about the job is i get free food even if it is making me fat; and i get my weekends off. I work the fry station mostly, and the kitchen is discussing. nothing is labeled, organized, or sealed. most of the ingredients I would never use in my own home.

My experience with Mcdonald's is an interesting one. When I first started working there three years ago it was fun and we could all laugh and have fun while working. Now even though we laugh and still have fun it's more stressful. Not all of Mcdonald's stores are like that but mine is. I want the attitude to change. It's not a stressful job unless you make it stressful and that's what is happening. The store is short staffed and we can't receive overtime so I understand it puts pressure of the General Manager but at the same time he should not take his stress out on his employees. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and just want to scream but I still try to stay positive and make sure the customers have a nice experience.

Working at McDonald's is a give-or take. It's impossible for me to truly do the company accurate justice when describing my work experience, because McDonald's are so diverse and different and rapidly changing. I worked for an owner-operator location, and the first three years of my employment were great. I was able to rise from a crew-person to eventually a manager, before I left for college. My work environment was great as a crew, and co-workers, though many were rough and lacked work-ethics, were rather pleasant. When I came back in the summers after college, the turnover had completely changed the crew, and the environment changed to a complete mess, nothing like the pleasant restaurant it was before. As a manager who rose up in the ranks of responsibility, I was also subject to the awful leadership and unethical choices of my superiors. Like I said, it's give or take, and always changing at McDonald's. Cannot truly say either way with full confidence the whole truth about it.

My experience at McDonald's was in the middle. On some days it was good, on others it was bad.

Yes, that's a Mexican neighborhood, a lot of racism going on and also favoritism in the restaurant.

The reason why I am rating it a 3, is because the work was easy though the down fall of it was the customers. You really have to have a lot of patience with them and just to be aware.

My experience with McDonald's was a first job experience and was great. I loved working there for the first two months, however it went extremely downhill immediately after two months. My team lacked communication and my supervisors were unwilling to work with me for a schedule alteration due to school. I would like the communication and team quality to change.

I like working here at McDonald's. It's a fairly easy job, for a decent wage. I learned a lot of vital skills, like communication, customer service, and money management (working at the cashier.)

the employees are always super fun to work with.

This McDonalds is high tech but what I would love to see in the future is a two story McDonalds with an elevator/ stairs the future is near and bring one will attract more customers you can have outlets on the top for those who want to just come and study and have coffee and then downstairs can be for those who want to eat and watch there children play.

Working at Mcdonald's was something I said i would never do. Now, as a Sophmore in college, Mcdonald's has given me SO many opportunities. Not only are they very flexible with my schedule, but they also are very understanding and allow me to study in my down time. Another great thing about my company is they offer $2500 a YEAR in tuition assistance. On top of the $2500, they offer 50 cents for every hour worked towards tuition. For example, if I work 1000 hours, they put $500 towards my education!

I worked my way up from crew to Assistant General Manager over a 2 and a half year period.

McDonalds is a great place to work at. My managers and bosses go out of their way to ensure that my needs are met and provide an excellent work space to be in.

Working at McDonalds in Hemet CA has taught me so much. It was and still is my first job. At first I was very nervous about working with customers and having a boss. I wanted to be the best and preform the best infront of my bosses. I learned my duties very fast and was able to preform every postion they need me in. The most I enjoy about working at McDonalds is my bosses and my crew. I'm able to be myself around all of them. Not only are they my bosses and colleauge but they became my friends. The hardest part of working there was learning how to multi-task and work under a whole lot of pressure. We are constantly moving and busy. I even became a crew trainer which means I teach and coach new employees.

Like any job, McDonald's has its ups and downs. For myself personally, most of the night management and crew are enjoyable and pleasant to work with. Dishes and lobby aren't too bad either.

Working with the company McDonald’s is an everyday challenge! Not only physically but mentally as well. Working with people can be very difficult at times especially when encountering an upset customer. On another note, there are days customers turn a frown upside down which is very rewarding. I’d like people, customers to understand McDonald’s is a very challenging job and it has its pros and cons to providing costumer service- job task may seem easy but they are definitely not. Satisfaction is McDonald’s goal, but I would also like McDonald’s to improve in certain areas such as putting their employees first as well. We get humiliated at time by costumers and there should be better accommodations to employees for tolerating such treatment.

I started working here when I was seventeen. I originally had this job to save up for a car, but then decided to stay and become management. When I became a manager, it was a hard transition because some of the crew members did not see me as their manager. As the years went by, I have now gained their trust as a manager.

I worked as a griller during the Summer of 2014 to raise money for studying abroad in Japan. It was quite an experience, but at the time I worked there much of the equipment was outdated and breaking down. I believe it has been updated since I have been there, though. My pay started at around 7.20/hr. I was kind of disappointed with this seeing as I just came from a job that paid 8.50/hr. Most of my fellow coworkers were excellent people, however some of the staff, including the management, weren't good.

Very a great place to work when you need a flexible schedule. They also offer tuition assistance. The management will be sure that your schedule is good and if not will fix it accordingly.

I like my coworkers and flexibility of working different shifts. The job I would say is pretty easy to learn. You just have to be good at dealing with the general public.

I can safely say that it was a very good first job, however, that is all I can say. I have worked here for around nine months and it has steadily went down hill since the beginning.

McDonald's is a great place to work, especially being a first time job. Currently I am in school so its great because Mcdoanlds is very flexible when it comes to hours, they will definitely work with you and your new school schedule every semester or term. Mcdoanlds does give you a free meal every 8 hours of work which is usually a shift, they usually never make you work more than you want to unless you ask for more hours than they will find a way. Mcdoanlds always has great benefits as of health care and 401K plans. I've worked at Mcdoanlds for 5 years and love it the only change I would make is better communication, communication is key when it comes to the employees and the customers.

McDonald's jobs hold a negative connotation, but working at my establishment for nearly 3 years has taught me valuable life lessons, such as working hard and enduring the not-so-good times, that I will carry until I die.

It is a good starter job but I wouldn't stay here longer than a few years.

It is a good job to start off with as a teenager. One thing I would like to see change would be the pay. They want you to do more work than necessary for so little pay.

I loved that at my McDonald’s they understood I had things to do senior year and let me be off for that. On thing I would like them to change is management.

My main concern getting a job was that I'd have trouble finding one that I would be able to keep while going to school for my ADN degree. They are so accommodating of my school and internship hours. The other workers are a delight to be around. There's no one I feel uncomfortable working with. I have learned so many invaluable skills that most people overlook when they see that I work at a McDonald's.

I worked for McDonalds for 3 years and i must say it was a really enjoyable place to work at. However, they had me as a crew trainer because I was the “best” person to do so.

McDonald's is always a great first job working here was an awesome experience. It shouldn't be a forever job though it should get boring.

My experience at McDonald's is one of kind. I hated working there. Everything was unorganized, the managers were intolerant to any mistake, and I barely received training for my position. Anything that I was asked to do I had to figure out myself. If I messed up, I would get yelled at. Anytime I asked a question I would get an answer given out of frustration.

I worked at McDonald's for three months and it may have been the worst three months of my life. The crew was very unintelligent, the managers were as well. It just made me so furious to work under management that didn't understand the fact that I had a life outside of work, that I wasn't on call for them 24/7, and that sometimes sickness occurs. I got threatened several times to be fired, just for being sick or wanting to leave on time. I highly recommend working ANYWHERE but here.

I liked that they are able to work with my schedule. Understanding if I need to switch my shift with someone else if I had some type of emergency.

McDonald's is an easy entry-level job for people starting out in life. It's benefits are not so good, salary is not so good, but hey its a job and you have one. Most issues you will run into are consumer wise and not so much staff. You will find that staff are actually nicer than the customers in a sense that they too are probably 16-19 year olds. Overall, with the flexible work hours due to many teens applying and working there it makes McDonald's a decent entry level job.

I love working here when it is presented what we work for , for example I work for the guest service department. I love to make the store organized and pleasing to our guest. Birthday parties are my favorite, I was the go-to birthday party host at my store, and every since I loved bringing happiness to the kids.

Overall, McDonalds did provide me with basic work foundations. It did not provide me with a great environment. People that I worked with were very deceitful and backstabbing. I worked there for two years but did not entirely enjoy it. Factors that can help to contribute to help, would be better training techniques and better observations on who exactly you hire.
